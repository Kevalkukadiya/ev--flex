            <p>EV Flexis a national network of EV chargepoints, mainly owned by private individuals and businesses.</p>

<p>You don't need to list a chargepoint to use the EV Flexnetwork, but we hope you will (and youâ€™ll get a discount on the price you pay).</p>

<p>If you add your chargepoint, other EV owners pay you to use it at whatever fee level works for you. You can make your EV chargepoint available on days that suit you and at times that fit around your needs.</p>
